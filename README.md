# Google Translate Clone 

With this project I will enhance my learning in HTML, CSS and Typescript, while searching for new challenges.
I think this project is perfect, to apply my web development knowledge. First, I tried to connect my application with OpenAI api but 
I had different problems, but I solved them by searching for others options. Finally, I used an API ([MyMemory](https://mymemory.translated.net/)) to translate the text.
